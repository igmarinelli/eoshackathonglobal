### The Online Hackathon

EOS is an annual competition of Brazil Conference at Harvard & MIT \("Brazil Conference"\). Our mission is to unite Brazilians from the most diverse branches - be they among the most skilled of the makers, the most creative of the designers or the most passionate of the entrepreneurs - so that we can make a difference in our country. All the challenges facing our nation are at stake and HackBrazil aims to help accelerate startups, assemble prototypes and connect people to the search for concrete solutions. Participating HackBrazil teams will have access to mentoring, resources and, in particular, contacts \(with other HackBrazil hackers, sponsors and partners\). In the last phase of the Competition, 5 selected teams will make their final pitches during the Brazil Conference 2019, which will take place in April 2019 at MIT and at Harvard. These teams will have access to several panels during the Conference and will play the fundamental role of representing the Brazilian technology. The winning team and second place will be chosen by our jury and will receive the final prize in financial resources.
