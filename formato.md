Teams should consider the following rules:

* Each registered team may only submit one idea for the purpose of the Hackathon.
* Participants may not be part of more than one registered team.
* Teams must contain at least two participants, so individual entries will not be accepted. 
* Participants must be active and engaged members of the team.
* There is no maximum limit for the number of people who can work on the project, but the team can only register at most 3 members as representatives, which will be the points of contact between the Hackathon and the team.

### 1. IDEATION

**Up to 100 teams** will be selected for the moving to the Ideation phase, which will consist of a short video describing the team and project to be worked on. More specific details about the video will be communicated to qualified teams.

All members of the selected teams will receive an invitation to access the platform of [**Shawee**](https://shawee.io) **\("Platform"\)**, in which they can communicate with mentors and other participants of the Competition.

### 2. DEVELOPMENT

 Among the teams that are part of the Ideation phase, a maximum of 30 teams will be selected to the Development phase. 

The first part of the Development will consist of assigning mentors to each team. This will occur within the Platform, with hackers being integrated into the EOSIO network, with access to mentors and other participants of the Hackathon.

In the second part of the same phase, follow-ups will be conducted through a conversation held by Skype, Google Hangout or other online conversation platform with a duration of 15-30 minutes, so that the evaluation committee and the mentors of EGOH can follow the teams. A calendar will be available on the platform in more detail.

Follow-up must be done within the stipulated time period. In case of failure to comply with the deadline established herein or any other obligation set forth in these Rules, the team will be eliminated.

### 3. FINAL PITCH

The webinar will be attended by special guests from the most diverse areas, including investors and important names of the technology area in the EOSIO scenario. More details on the final stage will be announced after the announcement of the finalist teams.

After the pitch, the winning team will be chosen by our jury and will receive the final prize in financial resources.
